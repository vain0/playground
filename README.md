# Playground
Set of tiny projects.

## Directory Structure
- **play**:
    - Set of incomplete projects.
    - Directory names start with the date when the project started just for lexicographical sort.
    - Completed projects are moved to another directory or published as an isolate repository, using ``git subtree`` or something.
- **scripts**:
    - Small, one-time scripts. Sorted by start date.
- **seeds**:
    - Templates of projects. Should be replaced with template generator tools.
