# Sharperform

CLI app to generate C# source code ahead of time by analyzing attributes.

- **Dev Status**: Still in early stage. No releases yet.

## Features

*This section is a wish list.*

For example, once the following code is given,

```csharp
// Written by Human

[Sharperform.Record]
public sealed partial class Person
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public int Age { get; }
}
```

it will emit the following boilerplate in a separate document:

```csharp
/// <auto-generated />
public partial class Person
{
    public Person(
        string name,
        int age
    )
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    public override Equals(object obj)
    {
        return Equals(obj as Person);
    }

    public bool Equals(Person other)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(other, null)) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, other)) return true;
        return Name == other.Name
            && Age == other.Age;
    }

    // and GetHashCode, operator ==, etc.
}
```
