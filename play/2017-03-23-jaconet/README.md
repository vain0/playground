# Jaconet
**Jaconet**, a set of class libraries for .NET Core, is currently just a playground.

The core concept is to *ignore .NET manners*. For example, Jaconet.Collections provides ``Seq<_>`` interface, which is equivalent to ``IEnumerable<_>`` but has different name not starting with the prefix `I`.
